# Connect-4
A connect 4 game with MongoDB atlas as backend. One can play against other locally or through a LAN. Furthermore, one can retrieve the most recent game played. Currently working on creating an AI that can play against humans.

# Learned Objectives
Through this game, I learned about sockets, multi-threading, and the basics of using MongoDB for CRUD operations.
